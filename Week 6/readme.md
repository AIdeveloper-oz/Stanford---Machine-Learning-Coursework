## Advice for Applying Machine Learning

When deciding on what to try next during machine learning algorithm development, there are steps that should be considered.

An example could be if we implemented regularized linear regression to predict housing prices but the hypothesis makes unacceptable large errors in its predictions. In this case we should try to:
* Get more training examples
* Get additional features

A diagnostic is a test you can run to gain insight what is/isn't working with a learning algorithm, and gain guidance as to how best to improve its performance. Although diagnostics can take time to implement, doing so can be a very good use of time.

The training/testing procedure for linear regression is depicted in Figure 6-1.

Likewise, the training/testing procedure for logistic regression is as follows:
